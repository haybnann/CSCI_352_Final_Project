\begin{abstract}
This project is an application for those who are planning for their retirement at any point in their career. The goal of the project is to allow the user's to set retirement saving's goals and track their progress along the way. It can also be used to forcast what your savings will be if you adhere to a certain investment strategy.

\section{Introduction}
This project will allow a user to enter in financial information such as income, filing status, year, as well as whether they are contributing to a pretax retirement savings account to accurately calculated taxes and tax deductions for each tax year. This will allow the app to accurately reflect its user's financial history as well as help them to plan for their retirement while early in their career, which is most beneficial due to compounding interest.

\subsection{Background}
This application may include large amounts of financial jargon such as marginal tax rates, adjusted gross income, etc. We aim to make definitions and explanations of these terms available in app, so we can make this information more accessible. 

\subsection{Impacts}
This application should impact the financial literacy of its users, since financial education is sorely lacking in most education programs.

\subsection{Challenges}
I expect some headaches when we start to implement the tax laws and regulations since it will be time consuming to get everything correct and easily changeable.

Current challenges are how we should document all of the tax brackets and we are debating on using a database with each table storing one year's tax bracket data.

\section{Scope}
At the completion of this project the end user will be able to enter information that will affect their tax status such as salary, filing status, and location and then the app will project how this will impact their retirement savings accounts and provide the user a resource to show how much they need to save and invest per year to meet their goals.
\subsection{Requirements}
The following requirements were generated based on the information needed to make financial advice.

\subsubsection{Functional}
\begin{itemize}
\item The application will store the user's financial history data.
\item The user will have a profile that will be able to be accessed on multiple visits
\item The application will give the user their projected retirement savings account worth.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Non-Functional}
\begin{itemize}
\item The data will be stored securely within the database.
\item The application will be responsive to all user input and be intuitive to use.
\item The application will reliably provide the user with accurate data projections.
\end{itemize}

November 23 - Present Project

\section{Project Structure}
The UI is structured so that each page uses the same basic format with special buttons or features that have unique abilities.\\\\
The backend contains a database with tax bracket data. It also will do all of the calculations to find what taxes a user will pay  and can project what the user's net retirement savings will be in the future. The user's profile contains a list of all the historical tax data for the user in a list. This allows the functions to easily iterate over the list to look up tax bracket data from the database to calculate the taxes and other retirement savings predictions.

\subsection{Design Patterns Used}
We will likely use the decorator factory pattern to design each page of the UI, since each one needs to be implemented slightly differently.\\
