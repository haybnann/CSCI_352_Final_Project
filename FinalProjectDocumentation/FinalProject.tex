\begin{abstract}
This Project will be a financial advisor type app, currently it has a temporary name: Edward after Edward Jones. You can give it your salary, location, and tax information and it will provide you with ways to reduce taxable income and responsibly invest some of your savings. The target of this application is the general consumer who is interested in learning about personal finance and ways that they can maximize their take-home income. So far we have outlined some of the major goals of our app.

\section{Introduction}
This project is an application anyone can use to help then plan their budget, calculate taxes, and get advice on how to responsibly invest their money. This application targets everyday consumers and anyone with an income stream. 

The user will be able to receive financial advice and budgeting tips that are dependent on the user's salary, spending habits, and various other factors. The information given to the user is intended to help the user become financially responsible and generally more aware of what they are using their money for.

\subsection{Background}
This application may include large amounts of financial jargon such as marginal tax rates, adjusted gross income, etc. We aim to make definitions and explanations of these terms available in app, so we can make this information more accessible. 

\subsection{Impacts}
This application should impact the financial literacy of its users, since financial education is sorely lacking in most education programs.

\subsection{Challenges}
We expect some headaches when we start to implement the tax laws and regulations since it will be time consuming to get everything correct and easily changeable.

Record keeping of money transfers will likely be an issue and well as potential runtime lag, since it will likely be doing lots of math.

The user interface and general design will be a time consuming task that will take many iterations to come to a consensus on.


\section{Scope}
At the completion of this project the end user will be able to enter information that will affect their tax status and the app will give them financial advice. Once the app meets the needs for a majority of the US general population it could be considered complete.

\subsection{Requirements}
The following requirements were generated based on the information needed to make financial advice.

\subsubsection{Functional}
\begin{itemize}
\item Each user will have a profile that contains information about the user's net worth, salary, and user transactions.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Non-Functional}
\begin{itemize}
\item The user will have an account number, password, and other private information.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Use Cases}
\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Use Case ID & Use Case Name & Primary Actor & Complexity & Priority \\
\hline \hline
1 & View Profile & User & Low & 1\\
\hline
2 & Salary & User & Low & 1\\
\hline

\end{tabular}
\caption{Use case table}
\label{tab:useCaseIndex}
\end{table}


\begin{itemize}
	\item[Use Case Number:] 1
	\item[Use Case Name:] View Profile
	\item[Description:] The user on our application wishes to view their account and the information contained in there. They will click on the "View Profile" button. Which will then refer them to their profile screen with their information contained in it.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item User wishes to see their account profile, first they would need to log into their account.
	\item The user then clicks on the View Profile button.
	\item The user is then directed to the profile page where they can view their information
	\item[Termination Outcome:] The user now is able to view their profile and view their information.
\end{enumerate} 


%item 2
\begin{itemize}
	\item[]  
	\item[Use Case Number:] 2
	\item[Use Case Name:] Salary
	\item[Description:] The user in the application's home screen can tap on this button to view their current salary and how much they are earning, along with their paychecks and incoming and outgoing payments.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item User wishes to see their salary.
	\item User clicks on the View Salary button.
	\item The user is directed to the Salary page where they can view their information
	\item[Termination Outcome:] The user now can view their salary information.
\end{enumerate} 

%item 3
\begin{itemize}
	\item[]
	\item[Use Case Number:] 3
	\item[Use Case Name:] Home
	\item[Description:] The user will be able to go to the home screen to see updates about their information, including salary and transactions.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The user wishes to view the home page.
	\item When the user loads up the application, this page is default, but if they are in another tab, they will click on the Home button.
	\item The user is directed to the Home page of the application.
	\item[Termination Outcome:] The user can now view the home screen and see their information.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Interface Mockups}
We plan to include a wireframe diagram in future editions of this document showing the general layout of the application.

\section{Project Timeline}
We will add project timeline in the next update.

\section{Project Structure}
We will add the project structure in the next update.

\subsection{UML Outline}
We will generate a UML Outline in next weeks deliverable.
%Below is the UML Outline, but was unable to get it to fit correctly into the PDF. Will change later.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Design Patterns Used}
To do next submission.


\section{Results}
We have a general idea of where we want our project to head towards. We will be brainstorming more ideas and will document them as we complete each goal that we have set for the next upcoming deliverables.

\subsection{Future Work}
The next steps are to create a UML diagram of the project and get a minimum viable product working that allows the user to submit a salary amount and returns their predicted after-tax income.
